12,200 young talented people, now it's our turn!
from Aomoxo's founders

     
Dear talented friends:

Imagine how it would feel to own any 1/1000 of the shares of either Apple, or Microsoft, or Amazon, or Google.

You will see the tremendous power of shares under a trillion dollars market cap:

1/1000 of shares is worth 1 billion dollars;
1/10000 of shares is worth 1/10 billion dollars;
1/100000 of shares is worth 1/100 billion dollars.

Now imagine again, what would happen if the trillion dollars market cap were to be used to motivate talented employees?

Trillion dollar market cap can make:

1,000 billionares, each with the net worth of 1 billion dollars, or

10,000 1/10-billionares, each with the net worth of 1/10 of billion dollars, or

100,000 1/100-billionares, each with the net worth of 1/100 of billion dollars;

Today, Aomoxo Company is making entrepreneurial history with the boldest attempt ever: Putting the vast majority of the trillion-dollar market cap into motivating our team members, let each of them embrace the dream of "being a billionare"( or 1/10-billionare or 1/50-billionare or 1/100-billionare), let talented people become the greatest contributors to the trillion-dollar market cap, and also the most benefited as well.

The most shares, the most billionaires.

Please allow us to introduce you to the "Aomoxo Program", the plan for Aomoxo Company to build another Apple, another Microsoft, another trillion-dollar market cap company, the core of which is "with the most shares in history, create the most billionaires in history". 

However, from a tiny wish, to making it happen, it's a complex and time-consuming process. It required us to be able to get rid of the influence and restraint of any existing thoughts, and unleash our wildest imagination. It also required us to be pragmatic enough to find our way back from the cloud of ideals, and down to earth. And finally we turned all our thoughts into a formal and logical solution, which will serve as the guiding principles for Aomoxo's goal of a trillion-dollar market cap.

So now, dear friend, please jump out of this article for a little while, and follow the two founders into the "Aomoxo Program", and you will see: 

How did we come up with the idea of "building another trillion-dollar market cap company", and from then on, taking on a completely different path, parting ways from other entrepreneurs forever; And how we drew on a blank shareholding structure chart, daring and carefree, a ambition of empowering as many as 37,200 people to embrace a "billionaire dream" gradually taking shape; and how by adapting to the tides of the internet era, it is now the easiest thing in the world for people everywhere to join Aomoxo, and they can enjoy the freedom and happiness in life, while still working for a big dream; and how by starting a entirely new entrepreneurial process of zero cost, Aomoxo will not repeat the failure of other start-up companies, will never suffer from business stagnation caused by capital chain rupture; and finally, how we managed to combine the goal of trillion dollar market cap with the ideal of changing the world, to connect thousands of personal dreams of becoming a billionaire with the fate of the entire human race.



All extraordinary achievements are born from extraordinary dreams

And welcome back! You must be vibrating with excitement: Finally, another truly ambitious company!

We believe that, to this day, there must be many talented friends out there in the IT industry, who still lament of missed opportunities in the past, back when they missed Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook ..., missed Alibaba, Tencent, and missed Xiaomi, Pinduoduo, Ticktok and other startups; and we also believe that many young people today, who are more mature and wise than the generation 20 years before them, have more awareness of new things such as startups, IPO, employee option, etc., and are much more willing to become early shareholding members of startup compnaies, rather than just being an ordinary employee, and are determined that never again will they miss the next Apple, next Microsoft...

However, when the new "Apples" are still in their infancy, it seems to be hard to recognize that they will become the powerful "Apple" in the future. And when facing today's Aomoxo, how can people connect it with the future Aomoxo, a trillion-dollar market cap company!

Fortunely, it's not the case. If you take a look at what Steve Jobs used to say, "the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do" , or read Google's Founders Letter, "Google is not a conventional company, We do not intend to become one", or listen to guidance of Bill Gates, "Have extraordinary ambition must have special achievement", or Bezos's advises,"Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful", then you should know that extraordinary achievements must all came from extraordinary dreams.

Aomoxo aims to become another Apple, or Microsoft, or Amazon, or Google, another trillion-dollar market cap company. As founders, we have stood with dreamers such as Jobs, Gates, Bezos, Brin, and Page for a long time, we see them as our teachers, our closest friends, our heroes. And now, with unprecedented courage and actions, we are showing everybody that the world is still moving forward, that there will still be new Apples, new Microsofts, new Amazons, new Googles rising up from the ground, and a new generation of assured, brave, highly capable dreamers coming out one by one! We're shouting out to all the outstanding young people who are eager to join the next "Apples": A new global stage full of ambitions and hopes, has already been set up, and the largest number of shares in history waiting just for you, NOW, IT'S YOUR TURN.

200 seats of billionare-class partner are ready for you

Aomoxo's first round of recruitment has already started. If you succeeded in joining, you would become one of the earliest members of Aomoxo Team and one of the 200 billionare-class partners.

The 200 billionare-class partners are the partners with the highest shareholdings in our team. Each holds 1/1000 of shares, and when Aomoxo truly become a trillion dollar market cap company in the future, each will gain the net worth of a billion dollars.

These 200 pioneers hold the most shares and also do the most important work: be the firsts to light up the engine of Aomoxo's "trillion dollars market cap action", and help pushing this new IT star onto the high-speed track to success.


The ten seats of Vice Presidents are also open to you

In addition to the two founders serving as CO-CEOs, Aomoxo will also set up ten vice president to form our management team. Any of the 200 billionare-class partners aspiring to management, are welcome to apply for it.

The ten VPs are actually members of 200 billionare-class partners. beside having 1/1000 of shares like others, each VP will be given the bonus of an additional 2/1000 of total shares, from the "2% Special Incentive Shares for the VPs". Under a trillion-dollars market cap, every one of the ten vice presidents will have 3 billion dollars of net worth.

Let's get it started to change the world with hundreds of incredible projects.

Today, it is time for another group of "newcomers" to come onto the stage, it is our turn to make a big change and shake the world with hundreds of incredible projects, our turn to fight for the dream of becoming a billionaire. The grand design of Aomoxo's "trillion dollar market cap action", will change our ordinary lives and create our own era.

In the not too distant future, when our wish's come true and Aomoxo has become a trillion-dollar market cap company, a new record will be set: 

Aomoxo team will produce the largest number of "billionaires" in history, which may exceed the sum of "billionaires" produced by all companies in globe with a market cap of more than $500 billion.

Now, brave "ambitionists", let's come together in Aomoxo from around the world for an extraordinary future, and get started to heroically build another trillion-dollar market cap company together!
