Aomoxo Program

To build another Apple, another Microsoft, another Amazon, another Google, and another trillion-dollar market capitalization IT company.


What'd it be like if one owns 1/1,000 of shares of either Apple, or Microsoft, or Amazon, or Google? or 1/10,000? or 1/100,000?

With a trillion dollar market cap, 1/1000 of shares is worth 1 billion dollars, 1/10000 of shares is worth 1/10 billion dollars, 1/100000 of shares is worth 1/100 billion dollars.

What if we use the trillion dollar market cap to motivate our employees?

A trillion dollar market cap can contribute 1,000 billionaires, or 10,000 1/10-billionaires (with a 1/10 billion dollars net worth) , or 100,000 1/100-billionaires (with a 1/100 billion dollars net worth).

And since it's so powerful, how about we use the future "trillion dollar market cap" to motivate people to build another trillion dollar market cap company?

Now please open your mind and take a crazy adventure with us!


Chapter One
Partner Shareholding Plan

"The most shares, the most billionaires."

Once we set up our goal toward a trillion dollar market cap, the next thing we plan to do is to give the majority of our shares to our team members, so that each of them will hold these precious resources and be given the rights to share the trillion dollar market cap, so that the greatest contributors to these wealth would also be the most benefited from it.

The above image is Aomoxo's shareholding structure chart. 

"The two founders hold only 3% of Aomoso's total shares, contributing the vast majority of the shares for building a trillion dollar market cap."

3% of shares is all we founders have left for ourselves, which may be the lowest founder's shareholding in history, but what we care about the most is that this humble number will allow us to use 97% of Aomoxo shares to do a real BIG THING.

"With 60% of shares, we will make 12,200 billionaires."

First, we're going to use 60% of shares to recruit 12,200 most brilliant and talented people around the world as partners, and officially form our team composed entirely of these 12,200 partners. And each partner will holds enough Aomoxo shares to ensure that she or he will be a billionaire (or 1/10 billionare, or 1/50 billionare) when Aomoxo reaches a trillion dollar market cap.

OK! Now let's take a look at the true power of shares with trillion dollar market cap, and see just how much shares each of the 12,200 partners will hold, and how rich will they really be under a trillion dollar market cap?


200 Billion-Class Partners

Each partner holds 1/1,000 of shares. With trillion-dollar market cap, 1/1,000 of shares is worth 1 billion dollars, the Aomoxo team will produce 200 billionaires.

They are the earliest team members that join Aomoxo, the pioneers and leaders of Aomoxo's trillion-dollar-market-cap-action, and also the top shareholding partners of the whole team.


2,000 1/10-Billionaire Class Partners

Each partner holds 1/10,000 of shares. With trillion-dollar market cap, 1/10,000 of shares is worth 1/10 billion dollars, the Aomoxo team will produce 2,000 "1/10-billionaires".
	
These are the team members joining in right after the 200 top partners, the backbone of the Aomoxo's trillion-dollar-market-cap-action, the force behind hundreds of great, world-changing projects. The 2,000 1/10-Billionaire Class Partners will be recruited in  one by one as these projects advance.



10,000 1/50-Billionaire Class Partners

Each partner holds 2/100,000 of shares. With trillion-dollar-market-cap, 2/100,000 of shares is worth 1/50 billion dollars, the Aomoxo team will produce 10,000 "1/50-billionaires".

After our 1/10-Billionaire Class Partners are fully in place and capable of taking on a huge team, the recruitment of 10,000 1/50-Billionaire Class Partners will be grandly launched. Their arrival will make Aomoxo a truly 10,000-person company, and also means that Aomoxo has prepared an army of the most qualified, talented people of the hightest number, for achieving the ambitious goal of making a trillion dollar market cap company.

With a trillion-dollar-market-cap, the Aomoxo team will contribute to the world:

200 people worth 1 billion dollars,
2,000 people worth 1/10 billion dollars,
10,000 people worth 1/50 billion dollars.

This is something that has never happened before, Aomoxo is creating history.

This is not an ordinary team, and every team member is not an ordinary employee. They are all Aomoxo's partners. They are the future shareholders of the company, the true owners, holding the company shares in their hands, and all sharing the wealth the company creates.

This is a group of "ambitionists". They join Aomoxo not to earn salaries, but to become a "billionaire", to make Aomoxo a trillion-dollar market cap company like Apple and Google.

Aomoxo's goal is to be achieved by these highly motivated "ambitionists".

Have extraordinary ambition，just have special achievement! -Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft Corporation



"2% Special Incentive Shares for the Vice Presidents, to help build the leadership team of Aomoxo."

With the two founders serving as CEOs, ten vice presidents will be selected from the 200 top partners to form the leadership team of Aomoxo.

Hence 2% Special Incentive Shares are set just for the Vps. An additional 2/1,000 of shares will be added to each of the ten vice presidents on the basis of 1/1000. With a trillion-dollar market cap, the net worth of each vice president will reach 3 billion dollars.

If the shares used for financing can be controlled within 10%, Aomoxo then is expected to use 25% more shares to our team, which is expected to contribute 25,000 more 1/100-billionaires to the world.

For caution's sake, we have reserved 35% of our shares for future financing needs.

However, Aomoxo is a zero-cost company with very little need for money, and the actual shares used for future financing may be much less than 35% (see Chapter 3 for details). Since Aomoxo's goal of creating a trillion dollar market cap depends on talented people, we wish to save as much shares for them as possible. Without affecting the company's normal financing needs, we will strive to improve financing efficiency, reduce the proportion of financing shares as much as possible, so we can put more shares into recruiting more elites.

If the shares finally used for financing can be controlled within 10%, then the rest 25% of the shares will be saved for further recruitment. With 1/100,000 of shares for each person, Aomoxo can add another 25,000 elites to its team which will produce 25,000 more 1/100-billionaires to the world when Aomoxo have a trillion dollars market cap.

If that really happens, it would mean that Aomoxo will be able to use 87% of its shares to gather and motivate 37,200 incrediblly talented people for the ambitious goal of achieving a trillion dollar market cap!

And when that goal is achieved in the future, not only can Aomoxo create 200 billionaires, 2,000 1/10-billionaires, and 10,000 1/50-billionaires, but it can also create 25,000 1/100-billionaires. What a miracle!

So Let us look forward to and work toward that bright future together!










Chapter Two
Internet-Based Global Company Framework

It is super easy for people around the globe to join Aomoxo.

Aomoxo will be a global company running completely on the internet, without any physical office and equipment. All Aomoxo Partners will no longer have to go to work in the company building every day like employees of other companies do, instead they could be anywhere in the world, working for Aomoxo online.

"Aomoxo Company is nowhere and everywhere."

Aside from the symbolic registered address, no building on this planet can represent Aomoxo, which is totaly online, without any offices, or any kinds of equipment, or highly integrated desks for employees; without grand halls for receiving clients, exquisite facilities, luxurious staff rest areas, cafes or kitchens that provide free lunches to everyone... all of those things that need lots and lots of money to build.

Aomoxo is a company constructed with the most fashionable building materials and the most advanced technology in modern society. It can be entered at top speed no matter where you are.


“Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one”
Founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page

"
Can we build a globalized team via the Internet? An idea we had many years ago now gives the answer.

Today in the age of the internet, we already have all the conditions we need to make use of the human resources around the world through the internet, and Aomoxo will be the first company to do so. Anyone with exceptional talents and qualifications no matter where she/he lives, can become a member of Aomoxo via the Internet, and together we will start a magnificent business, pursue the dream of a trillion dollar market cap, becoming billionaires, and changing the world at the same time.

It's also part of our globalization strategy. With our partners around the world, not only can Aomoxo do business in China which's the world's largest market, but can also quickly get into other countries with booming economies such as India and Vietnam, and also developed countries like the United States, Canada and Europe. We will do it fast, and with almost zero cost.

Aomoxo is a company that believes in ideals. As long as it is our dream, No matter what others do, we will spare no effort to pursue it boldly.

"Abandoning all the heavy shells other traditional companies have, Aomoxo will fly faster and higher."

Lightweight and elastic. Aomoxo is weightless, so light it can just float up. Whenever a new partner joins in, we don't need to prepare a new office for them, don't need to purchase new equipments, so expansion for us is very easy.

Manageability and high efficiency. Aomoxo doesn't need to provide workplace or food service for our partners, leaveing these matters to themselves, we can focus our most precious energy on ideas, products, markets, customers, things that are trully important.

Low consumption and zero cost. Aomoxo doesn't need to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and after, on maintainance, for start-up companies with big dreams and litte resources, it's a life and death difference.






Chapter Three

Zero Cost Model and Efficient Financing Strategy

"Let the wings of dreams remain strong even above the stormy seas."

It's hard to believe that Aomoxo, a company of more than 10,000 people, can grow and develop with nearly zero cost.

Aomoxo's Zero Cost Model, in and of itself, does not exsit as a single design, but inseprable to "The Partner Shareholding Plan" and "The Internet-Based Global Company Framework", like a coin with two sides, the Zero Cost Model is the other side of these ideas.

The Zero Cost Model includes two aspects: zero labor cost and "zero office cost".

Aomoxo will not need to pay salaries to our partners, especially when the company is not profitable, so at the early stage of our entrepreneurial process there won't be any personnel cost. 

It has to be reminded that, Aomoxo Team is made of tens of thousands of partners, not ordinary employees. The fundamental difference between the two is that each partner has a considerable number of share options and will be the true shareholder of the company in the future. They join Aomoxo, not to look foward to their payments every month, but to achieve extraordinary success, and the dream of becoming a "billionaire". So not only does the company not have to pay out salaries and bonuses and such, but in times of need, they may even have to help Aomoxo get through the hard time, just like what every entrepreneur will do for their company.

"Completely running on the internet, Aomoxo can exist and operate efficiently with zero office cost.

Establishing our company entirely on the internet not only allows us to achieve globalization easily, allows our people to enjoy a new found freedom, but also make Aomoxo extremely light for a company of more than 10,000 people, and there's no need to build or lease office space, to purchase all kinds of office facilities and equipments. All Aomoxo Partners will work in their own spaces, using their own personal computers and Wi-Fi networks, so Aomoxo can successfully remove all office expenses, and with zero personel cost and zero office cost, the total cost of running the company will remain zero.

"Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful."

Founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos

"With zero cost, Aomoxo is capable of building a team of more than 10,000 people in a very short period of time."

Under normal circumstances, creating an elite team of more than 10,000 people has an incredibly high threshold. Don't even think about it if you don't have strong financial resources.

First you'd have to be able to pay each team member their wages. At an annual income of 100,000 dollars per capita, a team of 10,000 people needs at least 1 billion dollars per year.

It's equally important to note, that for such a huge team to be up and running smoothly, only paying salaries is not going to be enough, but you will also need a sufficient amount of financial resources in order to build an office space that can accommodate tens of thousands of people. The one-time construction fees, and the subsequent maintenance costs, management costs, and all the other various office expenses, in a scale this large, could range from a conservative 10 million dollars to as much as 100 million dollars a year.

However, when we finally sat down and started innovating boldly, these seemingly scary roadblockers have all but dissapeared without a trace. So it dosen't matter if it's 12,200 people, or even doubling that number, Aomoxo can handle it, easily.

"With zero cost, Aomoxo's entire entrepreneurial process will never be threatened by capital chain rupture, and will withstand any storms coming our way."

In Aomoxo, there won't be a scenario where rent and utility bills cannot be paid on time, where employees are leaving because the company failes to pay them their wages due to financial problems, or where the capital shortage's causing serious business stagnation. Aomoxo's Zero Cost Model has completely eliminated the "soil" which breeds problems such as capital chain rupture. Even as a start-up company Aomoxo's strong enough to withstand harsh weather of any kind.

"No cash-burnings, no behind-the-curtain-speculatings, and no financing just for the sake of it, these are our earnest attitude towards financing."

Aomoxo aimes to create a trillion-dollar market cap. Such a dream cannot be made true by poor values and ideas. Aomoxo is to become a talent-intensive and technology-intensive company, not a capital-intensive company. Our entire business development depends on brilliant-minded people and their innovations. To us, there are always many choices and paths to choose, and we will not pick the money-consuming ones, so we won't be forced to make finding money our top priority.

And even when we have to spend money, we will always do so with the innovative spirit which created the Aomoxo Program: That is, use innovation not money to solve problems, and projects that would have required a lot of money, will be able to advance smoothly.

Every dollar we save can make our business less dependent on capital, we can have more shares to further strengthen our human resources, without having to sell it out to the capital. And with more people coming in, our company will become stronger and more robust, and will have more power to withstand any tests and blows and storms that we may encounter.

"Our financing strategy: starting from the F round or going straight to IPO, we will strive to control the shares used for financing to no more than 10%."

Although there are 35% of shares reserved for financing, our goal is to solve our financing problem with as few shares as possible. The advance of our company depends on talented people, and we will try to save as much shares for them as possible. If we really do managed to control financing within 10%, then in the future, with the rest 25% of the shares, 1/100,000 per capita, Aomoxo can add another 25,000 elite partners to our team.

Every share of Aomoxo is very precious and valuable, and should be playing a significant role, whether it is for recruiting or for financing.

As soon as the 200 top partners are in place, we will immediately set up a group of professionals to start communications and negotiation with investors around the world through the internet, and start "lobbying" our financing values to them.

We wish to cooperate with truly ambitious investment institutions, we wish to work with investors who understand and respect Aomoxo's value, and we wish that together we will make Aomoxo aother trillion dollar market cap company, and receive tremendous benifits from the huge success.

Aomoxo will keep exploring new ways to get money for the company, such as fundraising directly from the F round, or just skip all of that and go straight to IPO, et cetera. We will keep brainstorming and try everything to raise as many funds as possible with as few shares as possible.
















Chapter 4 
Our mission is to change the world 

"Change the world with hundreds of incredible and innovative projects. "

As the founders of Aomoxo, we have been heavily influenced by dreamers such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jack Ma(Alibaba), and Pony Ma(Tencent) for many years in our lives. We see them as teachers, as friends and role models, and have the words "change the world" deeply engraved into our minds. And bravely following their footprints, we're now finally walking on the path of changing the world. 

Creating Aomoxo, is our most daring exploration and attempt to achieve the dream of changing the world.

Creating Aomoxo, is the boldest exploration and attempt we made to this day for our dream of changing the world. We've made a brand new incentive mechanism of using the majority of wealth of a trillion-dollar market cap, to gather and motivate talented people around the globe to join us, linking the great mission of changing the world with each partner's dream of becoming a billionare. 

So here we are, announcing proudly to our partners:

"Like Google's break-throughs in AI, and SpaceX's plan of conquering Mars, Aomoxo will also become one of the bravest pioneers exploring new territories."

The world's most outstanding pioneers have already set great examples for us, showing that we can turn a rocket into a bus going and coming between earth and space repeatedly by reusing it, and that we can realize the dream of Mars immigration in a commercial way; showing that with enough computers working together, we can have the simulation of human intelligence, bringing cool technologies like face recognition and autonomous driving into our lives. 

There is no lack of pioneer genes in Aomoxo, we also have many wonderful new ideas to realize. And more importantly, with tens of thousands of extraordinary people who would bravely give up a comfortable and mediocre life, Aomoxo not only have the confidence, but also true strength to play the role of a pioneer and do what people think is impossible. 

"Competing with the world's most prominent IT companies, Aomoxo will be another wonderful choice to consumers. "

Aomoxo will do all kinds of business in IT world, and have friendly and positive competitions with the best companies, and together bring huge improvements to the lives of all human beings. 

Aomoxo will be challenging Tencent with a new messaging app just as good as WeChat and QQ, so that people can experience different joys from using different products; Aomoxo will also be competing with Alibaba, launching an brand new online shopping platform, different from either Taobao or Tmall, so that online shoppers can also have more diverse choices; Aomoxo will also expand our business abroad and play a leading role on the global stage, competing with Google, Amazon, Facebook etc, so that consumers all around the world can enjoy more diverse services offered by another wonderful company. 


"Bringing trust, hope and confidence to consumers, Aomoxo vows to become one of the world's most trusted brands."

We believe anything could be changed, and any problem could be solved. Aomoxo is a company dedicated to finding solutions to problems, always making things change for the better. Aomoxo will be there, in all aspects of people's lives, understanding their dissatisfactions and complaints, listening to their desires and dreams, and then turning all of these into solutions and projects. We want people to know that, Aomoxo is not an ordinary company caring only about making money, but a wonderful group of idealist with the sole mission to bring positive changes and wonders to the world. A most reliabale, trustworthy brand.



Only those "lunatics" who believe they can change the world are those who can really change the world.
